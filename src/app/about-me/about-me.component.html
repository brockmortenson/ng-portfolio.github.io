        I currently work as a Software Developer II. I specialize in web development and I have experience with various technologies. My expertise lies heavily in web-related technologies along with some non-web-related technologies sprinkled in (see 'skills' button above to view a more in-depth analysis of all my skills).

        In my free time, my number one priority is spending time with my wife. I also enjoy diving into new technologies, creating projects using those technologies, and staying up-to-date on the latest news in the tech world. Additionally, I like basketball and football, as well as being outdoors and strength training. I'm a big fan of video games and I even built my own PC to be able to switch from console.
